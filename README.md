# ATM Project
This is a project simulating ATM functionalities using REACT. 

## Description
When loaded, the screen will show the account balance and a selector with four options: null (default), deposit, cash back, and history. 
When deposit is selected, a div will appear with text Deposit and an input area. When a number is input, the account balance will update accordingly. 
When cash back is selected, a div will appear with text Cash Back and an input area. The submit button will be disabled if the number in the input area is bigger than the account balance. If a number less than the account balance is entered and submit, the account balance will be decreased accordingly.

## Improvements
When history is selected, a div will appear with text History. It will show the previous transactions in the order of oldest to newest.
